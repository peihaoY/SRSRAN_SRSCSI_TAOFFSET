# SRSRAN CSI & TA Offset Transfer

This repository contains a simple setup for transferring CSI (Channel State Information) and TA (Timing Advance) offset from a SRSRAN physical layer implementation to a host, and for real-time plotting of the received data.

## Files

- **srs_estimator_generic_impl.cpp**  
  Part of the SRSRAN project, handling the physical layer transmission. It sends CSI and TA offset to another host.  
  > ⚠️ Note: Update the destination address in the code according to your receiver's IP.

- **real_time_plot.py**  
  Receiver script that collects the transmitted CSI and TA offset and plots them in real time.  

- **example.png**  
  Example of the real-time plot generated by `real_time_plot.py`.

## Usage

1. **Setup the sender (SRSRAN side)**  
   Compile or integrate `srs_estimator_generic_impl.cpp` in your SRSRAN project.  
   Update the destination address to match the receiver host.

2. **Run the receiver**  
   ```bash
   python real_time_plot.py
